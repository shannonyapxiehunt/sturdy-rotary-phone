Pull Request Title: Move FileAssetSource.cs from Controllers to Models Folder

Description:
This pull request proposes moving the FileAssetSource.cs file from the "Controllers" folder to the "Models" folder in the C# ASP.NET MVC project. Currently, the FileAssetSource.cs file is located in the "Controllers" folder, but upon further review, it has been determined that it does not contain any controller logic, and its functionality aligns more with a model in the MVC architecture.

According to the Microsoft C# MVC documentation, models in ASP.NET MVC are responsible for representing the data and business logic of an application. They are typically located in the "Models" folder and are used to encapsulate the data and define the behavior of the application.

The changes in this pull request include:

Moving the FileAssetSource.cs file from the "Controllers" folder to the "Models" folder.
Updating the namespaces and references in the FileAssetSource.cs file to reflect its new location in the "Models" folder.
Updating any references to the FileAssetSource.cs file in the project to reflect its new location in the "Models" folder.
This change will align the project's structure with the recommended MVC architecture, as documented by Microsoft C# MVC guidelines, and improve the organization and maintainability of the project.

Please review the changes and provide feedback.
